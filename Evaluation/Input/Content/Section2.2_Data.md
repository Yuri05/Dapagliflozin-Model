Kasichayanula *et al.* ([Kasichayanula 2008](#5-references)) investigated the mass balance of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects after a single oral dose of 50 mg. The following table gives an overview of the results:

| Output                     | reported | normalized** |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Total recovery after 312 h | 96.15%   |              |
| Urine                      | 75.16%   |              |
| - unchanged                | 1.20%    | 1.23%        |
| - as metabolites           | 72.00%   | 73.93%       |
| Feces                      | 20.99%   |              |
| - unchanged                | 15.40%   | 18.90%       |
| - as metabolites           | 1.70%    | 2.09%        |

** to sum up to total excretion of urine and feces, respectively.

The metabolic pattern was determined as shown in the following table.

| Output                              | reported | normalized** | add fraction excretion to feces of unchanged dapagliflozin to  glucuronides*** |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Dapagliflozin-2-O-glucuronide       | 5.40%    | 5.47%        | 7.01%                                                        |

** to sum up to the values of metabolic quantifications from the table above (73.93% + 2.09%)

*** The fraction excretion to feces of unchanged dapagliflozin of 18.90% (see above) was added and distributed proportionally to dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide and dapagliflozin-2-O-glucuronide under the assumption that the measured fraction of unchanged dapagliflozin resulted from originally glucuronidated metabolites that underwent biliary excretion and subsequent degradation to dapagliflozin by bacterial glucuronidases in feces.

The following table shows the final mass balance data used for model building under the assumption of that unchanged dapagliflozin molecules in feces were originally glucuronides. Please refer to [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions) for rationale.

| Observer                                                     | Value      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged dapagliflozin       | 1.23%      |
| Fraction metabolized UGT1A9 (to dapagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide) | 78.80%     |
| Fraction metabolized UGT2B7 (to dapagliflozin-2-O-glucuronide) | 7.01%      |
| Fraction metabolized to oxidative  metabolites               | 9.11%      |
| **SUM**                                                      | **96.15%** |
